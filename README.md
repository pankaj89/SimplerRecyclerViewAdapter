SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter used to simplfy the adapter structure for RecyclerView.
  - Easy to use
  - No need to create adapter (Seperate java files)
  - Works with multiple view types
  - View holders are inside Activity or Fragment, so easily call methods of activity on row click.

### Latest Version (1.1)
  - Solved issue with multiple data and while scrolling (Changed structure for ViewHolder, See "Creating View Holder" Section).

### Download
Include the following dependency in your apps build.gradle file.
```
compile 'com.master.android:simpler-recycler-view-adapter:1.1'
```

### Creating View Holder
```java
SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter.SimplerRowHolder simplerViewHolder1 = new SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter.SimplerRowHolder<Student>() {

    @Override
    public SimplerViewHolder getAdapter(View view) {
        return new SimplerViewHolder(view) {

            TextView txtName, txtDesignation;

            @Override
            public void create() {
                txtName = links(R.id.name);
                txtDesignation = links(R.id.designation);
            }

            @Override
            public void bind(Student model) {
                isMyViewType(model);
                txtName.setText(model.name);
                txtDesignation.setText(model.designation);
            }
        };
    }
};
```

### Adding View Holder to RecyclerView
```java
SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter adapter = new SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter();
adapter.addViewHolder(R.layout.row_item_1, simplerViewHolder1);
adapter.addViewHolder(R.layout.row_item_2, simplerViewHolder2);
adapter.setList(list);
recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
```

### Comming Soon!!!
  - Add HeaderView (That will be available on top of recycler view.)
  - Add FooterView (That will be available on bottom of recycler view.)View
