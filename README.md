# Simpler Recycler View Adapter

SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter used to simplfy the adapter structure for RecyclerView.
  - Easy to use
  - No need to create adapter (Seperate java files)
  - Works with multiple view types
  - View holders are inside Activity or Fragment, so easily call methods of activity on row click.

### Download
Include the following dependency in your apps build.gradle file.
```
compile 'com.master.android:simpler-recycler-view-adapter:1.0'
```

### Creating View Holder
```java
SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter.SimplerViewHolder simplerViewHolder1 = new SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter.SimplerViewHolder<Student>() {

    TextView txtName, txtDesignation;

    @Override
    public void create(View itemView) {
        txtName = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.name);
        txtDesignation = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.designation);
    }

    @Override
    public void bind(Student model) {
        txtName.setText(model.name);
        txtDesignation.setText(model.designation);
    }
};
```

### Adding View Holder to RecyclerView
```java
SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter adapter = new SimplerRecyclerViewAdapter();
adapter.addViewHolder(R.layout.row_item_1, simplerViewHolder1);
adapter.addViewHolder(R.layout.row_item_2, simplerViewHolder2);
adapter.setList(list);
recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
```
